# Habitat

Simple collection of shell commands for managing apache2 websites.

### How it started

Used Laravel Homestead so far but i dislike VirtualBox, which in fact corrupted my Homestead VM by unknown reason and I lost my dev environment. Decided i will use Ubuntu in VMWare Workstation but had to manage dev sites somehow... and here we go!


### Roadmap
- Add proper output to the scripts and surpress their outputs
- Add more scripts for deleting sites, disabling sites, etc.
- Add database management scripts
- etc...
